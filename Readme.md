# FIUProject

This is the Android application that aims to detect and localize jamming signals by capturing radio signals and store signal strengths in a local database. Collected data could be synced to the remote host provided by Florida International University.

This project mainly based on the open source app "RF Analyzer" created by Dennis Mantz

Additional functionalities added to this app:

* Android SQLite local database 
* Data synchronization with remote host
* GPS tracker
