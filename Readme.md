# Jammer Localization via Smartphone

This is the repository for the Android application that aims to localize jamming signals in a desired bandwidth. It  captures radio signal data and stores it in a local database. Collected data is then synchronized to the remote host located in ECE Dept. of Florida International University.

You can find the implementation details and user manual in the documentation folder.

The open source app "RF Analyzer" created by Dennis Mantz is used in this application. 

Additional functionalities added to this app:
* Amplitude vs frequency calculation
* Android SQLite local database 
* Data synchronization with remote host
* GPS tracker
